# You're going to build a game named Zendo.

# The game is played over a series of rounds. In each round, you will be given one or more game pieces and a rule.

# Your task will be to determine if the game pieces follow the rule.

# Each game piece will have a color and a size. The possible colors and sizes are
# colors: red, blue, green
# sizes: small, medium, large

# You can represent the game pieces and rules using any data structures youâ€™d like.

# Round: 1
# pieces: one large red piece and one small blue piece
# rule: exactly one large red piece
# result: pass

# Round: 2
# pieces: two large red pieces
# rule: exactly one large red piece
# result: fail

# Round: 3
# pieces: two small blue pieces and one small red piece
# rule: less than three small blue pieces
# result: pass

# Round: 4
# pieces: one medium green, one medium red, one small blue
# rule: greater than one medium piece of any color
# result: pass

# Round: 5
# pieces: one large blue, one medium green, one small green
# rule: exactly two non-red pieces
# result: fail
